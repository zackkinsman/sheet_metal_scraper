Below is a high-level outline of how you might approach building this proof-of-concept system, from scraping real tender data through presenting interactive analytics and simple AI insights. This is meant as a flexible framework you can adapt to your exact needs.

1. **Identify & Ingest Real Tenders**
   - **Choose a Data Source**: Select one or two websites or public APIs that list actual tenders (government portals, procurement websites, etc.).
   - **Scraping or API Integration**: 
     - If there’s a public API, use direct calls to fetch data. 
     - If not, build a simple web scraper (e.g., Python’s `requests` + `BeautifulSoup` or `Selenium` for dynamic sites).
   - **Database Setup**: Store tender details (title, deadline, description, links, etc.) in a lightweight database (SQLite or a small PostgreSQL instance).

2. **Backend Logic & Data Handling**
   - **Data Model**: Create classes or schema definitions for “Tender,” “Company,” “Requirements,” etc. This ensures you can expand functionality later (e.g., tracking quotes or blueprint files).
   - **Data Refresh & Scheduling**: 
     - Implement a small script or scheduled job that updates the tender list daily or weekly.
     - Keep a log of when each tender was last checked or updated.

3. **PyQt Frontend for Interactive Display**
   - **Use Qt Designer**: 
     - Design main windows and dialogs visually (tender list view, tender detail view, AI “analysis” panel, etc.).
     - Convert `.ui` files into Python code or load them dynamically at runtime.
   - **Core Views**:
     - **Tender Dashboard**: Displays the list of tenders in a table or list widget, with columns for title, deadline, status, etc.
     - **Detail/Preview Pane**: When a user selects a tender, the right panel shows in-depth info (description, link to the original tender).
   - **Basic Filters & Sorting**: Allow users to filter tenders by date, keyword, or status.

4. **Basic AI/ML Analysis**
   - **Text Processing**: 
     - Use an NLP model (e.g., a small BERT or spaCy pipeline) to analyze the tender description for keywords: materials, project scale, region, or deadlines.
     - Summarize or extract key data fields (e.g., “Estimated Budget,” “Location,” “Technical Requirements”).
   - **Score or “Relevancy” Metric**: 
     - Based on the extracted keywords, produce a simple “match score” to show how relevant a tender might be to your hypothetical factory capabilities.
   - **Results Display**: 
     - Show the summary or keywords in the PyQt interface. 
     - Possibly highlight the top 3–5 reasons this tender might (or might not) be a good fit.

5. **Proof-of-Concept Workflow**
   1. **User Launches App**: PyQt app starts and loads the latest tenders from the database.
   2. **Dashboard**: The user sees all tenders in one place, can filter them, and click on each for details.
   3. **AI Insight**: Each tender has a short “AI Analysis” box showing extracted keywords, estimated complexity, etc.
   4. **User Action**: The user can mark a tender as “interesting,” “in review,” or “not relevant.”

6. **Architecture & Tech Stack Overview**
   - **Scraping / API**: Python scripts (requests, Selenium, etc.) scheduled via `cron` or a simple background thread.
   - **Backend**: 
     - Database: SQLite (easy to set up, portable for a proof-of-concept).
     - Data Access Layer: Simple Python modules to fetch, insert, or update tender data.
   - **Frontend**: 
     - PyQt for the GUI.
     - Qt Designer `.ui` files compiled or loaded at runtime.
   - **AI Component**: 
     - Start with a small pretrained NLP model. 
     - If needed, store model artifacts separately and load them in the backend or directly in the PyQt thread (for a POC, loading in the same process is usually fine).

7. **Next Steps & Future Enhancements**
   - **Enhanced AI**: Move beyond simple keyword extraction to more advanced classification or named entity recognition (e.g., auto-detect required manufacturing steps).
   - **Blueprint Analysis**: If you add PDF or CAD blueprint imports, you could later incorporate image analysis or object detection (OpenCV, specialized AI models) to identify shapes or features relevant to sheet metal fabrication.
   - **Cost Estimation**: Integrate a basic cost model if you have enough hypothetical or dummy data about material/labor costs.
   - **Workflow Automation**: Extend the app to automatically track tender deadlines, send email reminders, or even auto-generate partial quotes.

### Quick Example Flow (Hypothetical)

8. **Scraper**: A script runs each morning, grabbing new tenders from a public procurement website.  
9. **Database Update**: New/updated tenders are saved to SQLite.  
10. **PyQt App**: The user opens the app, sees a list of 20 new tenders.  
11. **AI “Score”**: For each tender, the AI module extracts relevant keywords (e.g., “sheet metal,” “fabrication,” “HVAC ducting”) and flags the tender as “potentially relevant” if it finds the right matches.  
12. **User Interaction**: The user clicks a tender, reviews details, then marks it as “pursue” or “ignore.”  
13. **Proof-of-Concept**: Even if you don’t have perfect data about your real production capabilities, you’ve demonstrated the end-to-end pipeline: data ingestion → AI analysis → interactive display.

This structure gives you a working demonstration of how the final solution might operate—scraping real tenders, presenting them in a user-friendly interface, and applying basic AI. You can then iterate, refine, or add features as you gather feedback.

Whether you can complete this proof of concept in 2.5 weeks depends on how ambitious you get with each feature and how comfortable your team is with the tech stack. In practice, it’s definitely possible to stand up a minimal end-to-end demonstration in that timeframe, provided you keep your scope laser-focused on essential tasks. Below are some considerations and suggestions for making it feasible:

14. **Limit the Scope of Data Acquisition**  
   - **Pick One or Two Sources**: Instead of attempting a broad aggregator, focus on a single website or API that provides tenders.  
   - **Keep Scraping Simple**: If you choose a site that requires JavaScript rendering (like a dynamic site), consider using Selenium or Playwright, but only scrape the minimal fields necessary (title, date, link, etc.).

15. **Basic Database & Data Structures**  
   - **Lightweight Implementation**: Use SQLite for quick setup. Keep your table schema straightforward (a few columns for tender details).  
   - **Single Cron/Scheduled Job**: Have one Python script that runs every day or on-demand to fetch new tenders.

16. **PyQt + Designer**  
   - **Minimal UI**: One main window that lists tenders, and a detail panel or modal dialog.  
   - **Basic Sorting/Filtering**: Implement a QTableView or QTreeWidget with the built-in sort/filter features. Save advanced UI extras (e.g., custom search boxes) for later.

17. **Simple AI/NLP**  
   - **Keyword Extraction Only**: Instead of building out a full classification model, start with a simple keyword match or a small, pretrained NLP pipeline.  
   - **Scoring**: A basic “relevancy” score based on how many target keywords appear in the tender description.

18. **Workflow**  
   - **Minimum Workflow**: Present the user with a list of tenders, allow them to mark each as “Interested” or “Not Interested.” Store that status locally or in the same database table.

19. **Time Allocations**  
   - **Days 1–3**: 
     - Finalize which data source to scrape. 
     - Write the scraper/API script to store the data in SQLite.  
   - **Days 4–7**: 
     - Build out the PyQt UI skeleton (dashboard + detail view). 
     - Load data from SQLite into the interface.  
   - **Days 8–11**: 
     - Add the simple NLP/keyword extraction step. 
     - Display an “AI Analysis” column or panel in PyQt.  
   - **Days 12–14**: 
     - Polish up the UI, fix bugs, finalize minimal design elements, and test the entire flow end to end.

20. **Testing & Deployment**  
   - **Iterative Testing**: Start testing the scraper day one. Validate the UI continuously so you don’t have a major integration headache at the last minute.  
   - **Lightweight Deployment**: For the proof of concept, you can run everything locally. If you need to demo it off-site, just bundle the code or use an installer builder for PyQt (e.g., PyInstaller).

#### Is 2.5 Weeks Realistic?  
Yes, if you **strictly limit** features to the essential MVP: (1) pulling tenders from a single source, (2) storing them in a simple database, (3) displaying them in a PyQt interface, and (4) applying basic NLP. You’ll want to minimize “nice-to-have” features like complex UIs, advanced AI, or multiple data sources until you have your core proof-of-concept working.

With that approach, you can confidently build something demonstrable in around 2–3 weeks.
