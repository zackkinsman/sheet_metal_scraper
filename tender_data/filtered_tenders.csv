Major, Andrea
Telephone No. - (403) 796-3230 

This RFSA cancels and supersedes the previous RFSA number EVC01-202003/B. Suppliers that provided an arrangement for EVC01-202003/A or EVC01-202003/B are not required to submit a new arrangement, and do not need to take any action. 

There are no changes from EVC01-202003/B to EVC01-202003/C. Version /C of the RFSA is being posted to extend the active solicitation period. 

The Government of Canada through this RFSA, intends to establish and maintain SAs with suppliers to provide medium and large Vessel recycling and disposal services of any Vessel requiring dismantlement in a Vessel Recycling Facility, for one or more regions/sub-regions of Canada in accordance with the Statement of Requirement - Annex A.

The RFSA includes two streams:

Stream A - Medium size Vessels with lightship displacement of 300 MT or less; and

Stream B - Large size Vessels with lightship displacement of over 300 MT. 

There may be security requirements associated with some of the requirements under this RFSA. For more information on personnel and organization security screening or security clauses, Suppliers should refer to the Contract Security Program of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC).

This RFSA is to establish supply arrangements for the delivery of the requirement detailed in the RFSA to the Identified Users across Canada, including geographic areas subject to Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements (CLCAs) and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (NLCA).

To meet the Government of Canada’s objectives of encouraging Indigenous socio-economic development through federally funded opportunities, resulting bid solicitations from this RFSA may be set aside under the Procurement Strategy for Indigenous Business (PSIB) or may include an Indigenous Participation Plan (IPP). For additional information on PSIB refer to the Indigenous Business and federal procurement site and for additional information on the Indigenous Participation Plan refer to Annex H - Indigenous Participation Component. 

Any resulting bid solicitation may be subject to the provisions of the trade agreements. Certain obligations under the trade agreements may not apply where the Vessel is located in the Nunavut region or an area covered by a modern treaty. If a set-aside for Indigenous businesses or an exception used of or relied upon (e.g. any measure adopted or maintained with respect to Indigenous Peoples, set-aside for minority businesses, etc.), some or all aspects of the procurement may not be subject to certain trade agreement obligations. 

To ensure that the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes is reduced to the minimum consistent with the environmentally sound and efficient management of such wastes, and to protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects which may result from the movement of vessels containing hazardous wastes, the Work must be performed within Canada.

If the Contracting Authority, in its sole discretion, determines that the Work cannot be performed within Canada in an environmentally sound and efficient manner, or if there are no suppliers who can perform the Work in Canada, the Contracting Authority may consider bids from suppliers who propose to perform the Work in another country only if that country is a Party to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal or Canada has concluded an agreement or an arrangement pursuant to Article 11 of the Convention with that non-Party.

Canada has the right to reject any request to perform the Work in a country other than Canada if it has reason to believe that the Work will not be managed in an environmentally sound manner.

Any resulting bid solicitation on behalf of the Department of National Defence may be subject to the Controlled Goods Program. For additional information on the Controlled Goods Program or how to register, consult the clause A9130T of the Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions Manual.
